         <div>
            <h4>a) var z;  alert(typeof z);</h4>
                <p>Result: It pops up and says "undefined".  <br>
                    Why: Because there is no value in z.


                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>b)alert(!!false);</h4>
                <p>Result: It pops up and says "false".<br>
                    Why: Because "!" means "not". "!false" = not false = true, "!!false" = not not false = false. 
             </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>c) alert(7%2);</h4>
            <p>Result: it pops up and says "1"<br>
                Why: the "%" will show the remainder.       
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>d) var name="Jim"; alert(name+" Smith");</h4>
            <p>Result:Pops up and says "Jim Smith"
                Why: because the variable name was assigned the string value of Jim. 

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>e) var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2); </h4>
            <p>Result: 52
                Why: Because the variable myNum was assigned the "string" value "5", which was treated as a string value instead an integer. 
                Therefore, 5+2 will not be calculate as 7 and will be presented as 52.
            </p>

<!--Part 2: Questions B (2.5 points)

You can describe the results as comments in your code or you may state the results by writing it onto the web page.


2. Explain the difference between the + and ++ operators in Javascript.
3. What are the differences between using window.alert(), console.log(), and document.write() ?
4. Explain the differences between =, ==, and the === operators.
5. Describe the differences between two types of loops: while and do while.-->





<!--Part 3: Exercise (5 points)
a) Create a program that prompts a user for their first name. 
b) After the user has entered their name then have the program convert the user’s name to all upper case (this will require some research on your own).
c) Create an alert, or document.write(), that greets the user by using a loop to print their name 3 times in upper case, with 'Welcome' in front of their first or last name.  

For example if I used the program it would alert: 

“Welcome AUSTIN!"

“Welcome AUSTIN!"

“Welcome AUSTIN!"-->
